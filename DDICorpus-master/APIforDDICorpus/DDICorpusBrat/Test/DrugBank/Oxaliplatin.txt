No specific cytochrome P450-based drug interaction studies have been conducted. No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg/m2 ELOXATIN and infusional 5-FU has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks. Increases of 5-FU plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m2 ELOXATIN dosed every 3 weeks. Since platinum containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds; although, this has not been specifically studied.
