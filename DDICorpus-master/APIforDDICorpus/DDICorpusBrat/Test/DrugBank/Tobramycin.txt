In clinical studies of TOBI, patients taking TOBI concomitantly with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME   , Genentech), (beta)-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, or parenteral aminoglycosides demonstrated adverse experience profiles similar to the study population as a whole. Concurrent and/or sequential use of TOBI with other drugs with neurotoxic or ototoxic potential should be avoided. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. TOBI should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or mannitol.
