In a pharmacokinetic study of 18 chronic hepatitis C patients concomitantly receiving methadone, treatment with PEG-Intron once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with a mean increase of 16% in methadone AUC; in 2 out of 18 patients, methadone AUC doubled. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of increased narcotic effect.
