Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Macugen. Pegaptanib is metabolized by nucleases and is generally not affected by the cytochrome P450 system. Two early clinical studies conducted in patients who received Macugen alone and in combination with PDT revealed no apparent difference in the plasma pharmacokinetics of pegaptanib.
