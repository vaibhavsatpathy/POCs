Melatonin may interact with the following drugs: aspirin and other NSAIDs (may lower melatonin levels), fluvoxamine (bioavailability of oral melatonin is increased with coadministration), beta blockers (may decrease melatonin levels), fluoxetine (reports of psychotic episodes when coadministered), progestin (coadministration of melatonin with progestin can inhibit ovarian function in women), benzodiazepenes and other sedating drugs (may result in additive sedation and an increased incidence of adverse effects), and corticosteroids (coadministration of melatonin and corticosteroids may interfere with the efficacy of the corticosteroids).
