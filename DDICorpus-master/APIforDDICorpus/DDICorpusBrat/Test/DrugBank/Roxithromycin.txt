Concomitant administration contra-indicated:  - Vasoconstrictive ergot alkaloids. Concomitant administrations not recommended:  - Terfenadine and astemizole: Certain macrolides interact with terfenadine and astemizole leading to increased serum concentrations of the latter. This may result in severe ventricular arrhythmia, typically torsades de pointe. Although such a reaction has not been demonstrated with roxithromycin, concomitant administration of roxithromycin with terfenadine or astemizole is not recommended. - Cisapride, pimozide: Other drugs such as cisapride or pimozide, which are metabolised by hepatic CYP3A isozymes have been associated with QT interval prolongation and/or cardiac arrythmias (typically torsades de pointe) as a result of increase in their serum level subsequent to interaction with significant inhibitors of the isozyme, including some macrolide antibacterials. Although such a risk is not verified for roxithromycin, combination of roxithromycin with such drugs is not recommended.
