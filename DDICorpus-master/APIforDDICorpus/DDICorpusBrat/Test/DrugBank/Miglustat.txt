While co-administration of ZAVESCA    appeared to increase the clearance of Cerezyme by 70%, these results are not conclusive because of the small number of subjects studied and because patients took variable doses of Cerezyme. Combination therapy with Cerezyme    (imiglucerase) and ZAVESCA    is not indicated.
