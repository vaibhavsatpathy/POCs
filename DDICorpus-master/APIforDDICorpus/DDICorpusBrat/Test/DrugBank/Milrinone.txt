No untoward clinical manifestations have been observed in limited experience with patients in whom PRIMACOR was used concurrently with the following drugs: digitalis glycosides; lidocaine, quinidine; hydralazine, prazosin; isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin; chlorthalidone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone; captopril; heparin, warfarin, diazepam, insulin; and potassium supplements. Chemical Interactions There is an immediate chemical interaction which is evidenced by the formation of a precipitate when furosemide is injected into an intravenous line of an infusion of PRIMACOR. Therefore, furosemide should not be administered in intravenous lines containing PRIMACOR.
