Caution is recommended when administering NEXAVAR with compounds that are metabolized/eliminated predominantly by the UGT1A1 pathway (e.g. irinotecan). Concomitant treatment with NEXAVAR resulted in a 21% increase in the AUC of doxorubicin. Caution is recommended when administering doxorubicin with NEXAVAR. Sorafenib inhibits CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 in vitro with Ki values of 6 and 1-2 ?M, respectively. Systemic exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 is expected to increase when co-administered with NEXAVAR. Caution is recommended when administering substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 with NEXAVAR.
