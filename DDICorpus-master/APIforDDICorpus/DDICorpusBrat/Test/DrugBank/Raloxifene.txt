Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine causes a 60% reduction in the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene and should not be coadministered with EVISTA. Warfarin: The coadministration of EVISTA and warfarin has not been assessed under chronic conditions. However, 10% decreases in prothrombin time have been observed in single-dose studies. If EVISTA is given concurrently with warfarin, prothrombin time should be monitored. Other Highly Protein-Bound Drugs: Raloxifene is more than 95% bound to plasma proteins. In vitro, raloxifene did not affect the binding of warfarin, phenytoin, or tamoxifen. Caution should be used when EVISTA is coadministered with other highly protein-bound drugs, such as clofibrate, indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen, diazepam, and diazoxide.
