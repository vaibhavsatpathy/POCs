Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. If signs of folate deficiency develop, pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored. Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.
