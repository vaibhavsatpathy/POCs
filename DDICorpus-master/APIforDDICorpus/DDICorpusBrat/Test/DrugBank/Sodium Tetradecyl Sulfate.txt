Interactions for Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate:  No well-controlled studies have been performed on patients taking antiovulatory agents. The physician must use judgment and evaluate any patient taking antiovulatory drugs prior to initiating treatment with Sotradecol. Heparin should not be included in the same syringe as Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate, since the two are incompatible.
