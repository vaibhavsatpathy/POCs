The bioavailability of SKELID is decreased 80% by calcium, when calcium and SKELID are administered at the same time, and 60% by some aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids, when administered 1 hour before SKELID. Aspirin may decrease bioavailability of SKELID by up to 50% when taken 2 hours after SKELID. The bioavailability of SKELID is increased 2-4 fold by indomethacin but is not significantly altered by coadministration of diclofenac. The pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin are not significantly modified by SKELID coadministration. In vitro studies show that tiludronate does not displace warfarin from its binding site on protein.
