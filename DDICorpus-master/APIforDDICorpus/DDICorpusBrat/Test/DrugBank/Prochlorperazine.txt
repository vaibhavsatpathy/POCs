Thiazide diuretics may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that may occur with phenothiazines. Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly. Concomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.
