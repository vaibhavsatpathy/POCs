Digoxin: Sparfloxacin has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Methylxanthines: Sparfloxacin does not increase plasma theophylline concentrations. Since there is no interaction with theophylline, interaction with other methylxanthines such as caffeine is unlikely. Warfarin: Sparfloxacin does not increase the anti-coagulant effect of warfarin. Cimetidine: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin. The oral bioavailability of sparfloxacin is not reduced when the aluminum-magnesium suspension is administered 4 hours following sparfloxacin administration. Zinc/iron salts: Absorption of quinolones is reduced significantly by these preparations. These products may be taken 4 hours after sparfloxacin administration. Probenecid: Probenecid does not alter the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin.
