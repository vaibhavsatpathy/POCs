Co-administration of SUTENT with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconizole) may increases sunitinib concentrations. Grapefruit may also increase plasma concentrations of SUTENT. Co-administration of SUTENT with inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, St. Johns Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations. St. Johns Wort may decrease SUTENT plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving SUTENT should not take St. Johns Wort concomitantly. SUTENT dose modification is recommended in patients using concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.
