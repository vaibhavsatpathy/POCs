Coadministration of TRITEC with clarithromycin resulted in increased plasma ranitidine concentrations (57%), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48%), and increased 14- hydroxy- clarithromycin plasma concentrations (31%). Coadministration with aspirin results in a slight decrease in the rate of salicylate absorption that is clinically unimportant. Coadministration with a high dose of antacid (170 mEq) results in a 28% decrease in plasma concentrations of ranitidine and may decrease plasma concentrations of bismuth from TRITEC. These effects are clinically insignificant. For information on drug interactions associated with ranitidine, refer to the ZANTAC     package insert.
