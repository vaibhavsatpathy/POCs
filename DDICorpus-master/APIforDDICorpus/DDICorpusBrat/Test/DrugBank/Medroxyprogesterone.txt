No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with depo-subQ provera 104. Aminoglutethimide administered concomitantly with depo-subQ provera 104 may significantly decrease the serum concentrations of MPA. Laboratory Tests The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted. The physician should be informed that certain endocrine and liver function tests, and blood components may be affected by progestin therapy: (a) Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol). (b) Plasma and urinary gonadotropin levels are decreased (e.g., LH, FSH). (c) SHBG concentrations are decreased. (d) T3-uptake values may decrease. (e) There may be small changes in coagulation factors. (f) Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased slightly. (g) There may be small changes in lipid profiles.
