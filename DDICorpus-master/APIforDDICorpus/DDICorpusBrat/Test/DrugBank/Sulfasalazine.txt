Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have been reported when those agents were administered concomitantly with sulfasalazine. When daily doses of sulfasalazine 2 g and weekly doses of methotrexate 7.5 mg were coadministered to 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients in a drug-drug interaction study, the pharmacokinetic disposition of the drugs was not altered. Daily doses of sulfasalazine 2 g (maximum 3 g) and weekly doses of methotrexate 7.5 mg (maximum 15 mg) were administered alone or in combination to 310 rheumatoid arthritis patients in two controlled 52-week clinical studies. The overall toxicity profile of the combination revealed an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events, especially nausea, when compared to the incidence associated with either drug administered alone. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: The presence of sulfasalazine or its metabolites in body fluids has not been reported to interfere with laboratory test procedures. REFERENCES 7.Farr M, et al.
