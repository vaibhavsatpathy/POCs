Pharmacokinetic studies show that there are no significant alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine or rifabutin to warrant dosage adjustment when megestrol acetate is administered with these drugs. A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that coadministration of megestrol acetate and indinavir results in a significant decrease in the pharmacokinetic parameters (~36% for Cmax and ~28% for AUC) of indinavir. Administration of a higher dose of indinavir should be considered when coadministering with megestrol acetate. The effects of indinavir, zidovudine or rifabutin on the pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate were not studied.
