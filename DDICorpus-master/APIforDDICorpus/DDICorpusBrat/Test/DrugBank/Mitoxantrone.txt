Mitoxantrone and its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine, but it is not known whether the metabolic or excretory pathways are saturable, may be inhibited or induced, or if mitoxantrone and its metabolites undergo enterohepatic circulation. To date, post-marketing experience has not revealed any significant drug interactions in patients who have received NOVANTRONE    for treatment of cancer. Information on drug interactions in patients with multiple sclerosis is limited. Following concurrent administration of NOVANTRONE    with corticosteroids, no evidence of drug interactions has been observed.
