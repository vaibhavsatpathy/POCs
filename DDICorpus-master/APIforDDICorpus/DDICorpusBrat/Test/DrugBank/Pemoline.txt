The interaction of CYLERT (pemoline) with other drugs has not been studied in humans. Patients who are receiving CYLERT concurrently with other drugs, especially drugs with CNS activity, should be monitored carefully. Decreased seizure threshold has been reported in patients receiving CYLERT concomitantly with antiepileptic medications.
