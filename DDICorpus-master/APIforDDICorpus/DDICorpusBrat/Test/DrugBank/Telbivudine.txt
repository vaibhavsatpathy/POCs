Telbivudine is excreted mainly by passive diffusion so the potential for interactions between telbivudine and other drugs eliminated by renal excretion is low. However, because telbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, co   administration of telbivudine with drugs that alter renal function may alter plasma concentrations of telbivudine.
