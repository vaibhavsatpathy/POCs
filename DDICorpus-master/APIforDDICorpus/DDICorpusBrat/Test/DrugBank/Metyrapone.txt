Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function, including all corticosteroid therapy, must be discontinued prior to and during testing with Metopirone. The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin; therefore, results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking phenytoin within two weeks before. Asubnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy. Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity.
