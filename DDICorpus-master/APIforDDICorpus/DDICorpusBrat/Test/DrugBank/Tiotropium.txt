SPIRIVA has been used concomitantly with other drugs commonly used in COPD without increases in adverse drug reactions. These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids. However, the co   administration of SPIRIVA with other anticholinergic   containing drugs (e.g., ipratropium) has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.
