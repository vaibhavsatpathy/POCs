Caution should be observed in administering DEMSER to patients receiving phenothiazines or haloperidol because the extrapyramidal effects of these drugs can be expected to be potentiated by inhibition of catecholamine synthesis. Concurrent use of DEMSER with alcohol or other CNS depressants can increase their sedative effects.
