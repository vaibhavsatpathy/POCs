Sulfoxone may increase the effects of barbiturates, tolbutamide, and uricosurics. It may also interact with thiazides (increased thrombocytopenia), cyclosporine (increased nephrotoxicity), sulfonylurea agents (increased hypoglycemic response), warfarin (increased anticoagulant effect), methotrexate (decreased renal excretion of methotrexate), phenytoin (decreased hepatic clearance of phenytoin).
