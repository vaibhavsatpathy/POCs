Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or ACTH. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. This diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Thiazide drugs may increase the responsiveness of tubocurarine. Lithium renal clearance is reduced by thiazides, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs. Potentiation occurs with ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs.
