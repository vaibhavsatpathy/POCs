CPP-ACP complex as a new adjunctive agent for remineralisation: a review. In addition to regular professional oral hygiene visits and the application of appropriate preventive medications, successful preventive strategies involve oral health promotion, patient education and patient compliance. The Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) complex has been shown to remineralise tooth surfaces in situ when delivered in oral care products. This complex has a unique ability to deliver bio-available calcium and phosphate when they are needed most. The effectiveness of casein derivatives, specifically CCP-ACP, in caries prevention and lesion reversal has been supported by many controlled clinical studies. This review summarises the research on Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate complex and provides information related to its benefit in dentistry. Further research is required to provide a scientifically supported recommendation for other clinical applications.
