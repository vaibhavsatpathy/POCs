[Tuberculosis and HIV - features of the co-infection]. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has allowed the incidence of tuberculosis to rise globally and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis is more complex in patients with HIV/AIDS.

The treatment of coinfected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomittantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Current guidelines recommend starting antiretroviral treatment within a few weeks of antituberculosis therapy for patients with CD4 cell counts 350 cells/ul.
