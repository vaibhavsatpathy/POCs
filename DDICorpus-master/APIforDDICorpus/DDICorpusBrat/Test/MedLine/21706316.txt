Effect of ketoconazole-mediated CYP3A4 inhibition on clinical pharmacokinetics of panobinostat (LBH589), an orally active histone deacetylase inhibitor. Panobinostat is partly metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. This study evaluated the effect of a potent CYP3A inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the pharmacokinetics and safety of panobinostat. Patients received a single panobinostat oral dose on day 1, followed by 4  days wash-out period. On days 5-9, ketoconazole was administered. On day 8, a single panobinostat dose was co-administered with ketoconazole. Panobinostat was administered as single agent three times a week on day 15 and onward. In the presence of ketoconazole, there was 1.6- and 1.8-fold increase in C (max) and AUC of panobinostat, respectively. No substantial change in T (max) or half-life was observed. No difference in panobinostat-pharmacokinetics between patients carrying CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3 alleles was observed. Most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal related. Patients had asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (64%), and urine analysis suggested renal phosphate wasting. Co-administration of panobinostat with CYP3A inhibitors is feasible as the observed increase in panobinostat PK parameters was not considered clinically relevant. Considering the variability in exposure following enzyme inhibition and the fact that chronic dosing of panobinostat was not studied with CYP3A inhibitors, close monitoring of panobinostat-related adverse events is necessary.
