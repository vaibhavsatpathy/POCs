[Influence of hemantane and doxycycline on MPTP-evoked behavior violations in C57BL/6 mice]. The effects of anti-parkinsonian drug hemantane [(2-adamantyl)hexamethylenimine] (10 mg/kg, p. o.) and/or antibiotic drug doxycycline (100 mg/kg, p. o.), as well as that of neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (4 x 20 mg/kg, i. p.) were studied in elevated plus maze test on C57BL/6 mice. On second day after injection, MPTP decreased the locomot or activity in comparison to saline. Acute administration of hemantane or doxycycline failed to influence locomotion in mice, while their combination normalized motor activity. The results obtained confirm the role of inflammatory processes in parkinsonism and suggest expediency of combined pharmacotherapy of neurodegenerative diseases.
