[Effects of glycyrrhiza extract on pharmacokinetics property of daphnetin in rats]. To research the influence of glycyrrhiza extract on the pharmacokinetics characteristic parameters of daphnetin, which was aimed to explore the rationality of concert application of drugs. The rats received intragastric administration of daphnetin and glycyrrhiza extract containing the same daphnetin respectively. The blood concentration of daphnetin was assayed by LC-MS. The data was processed by program DAS2.1.1. Glycyrrhiza extract can reduce the t(1/2), tmax and Ke of daphnetin, while increased the Ka and AUC(0-infinity). Glycyrrhiza extract promoted the oral absorption of daphnetin, slowed down the elimination and increased the biological availability.
