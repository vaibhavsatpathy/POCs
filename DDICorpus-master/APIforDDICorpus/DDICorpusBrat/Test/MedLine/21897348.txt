Ticagrelor (Brilinta)--better than clopidogrel (Plavix) The FDA has approved ticagrelor (Brilinta-AstraZeneca), an oral antiplatelet drug, for use with low-dose aspirin to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It will compete with clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Effient) for such use. Clopidogrel is expected to become available generically in the US within the next few months.
