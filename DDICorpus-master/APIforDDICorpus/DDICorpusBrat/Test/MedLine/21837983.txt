[Study on synergic and decreasing toxic effects of mineral water and Chinese herbal compound preparation on cisplatin]. The synergic and decreasing toxic effects of mineral water and Chinese herbal compound preparation (MWCHCP) on cisplatin were investigated in sarcoma 180 (S180) mice. The S180 mice were treated for 5 days with intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin(7.33 mg x kg(-1)) and oral administration of MWCHCP(1 925, 3 850, 7 700 mg x kg(-1)). Then the mice were killed and the tumor growth inhibition rate, organ index, diarrhea index were determined. Observe pathological sections of stomach to study the protective effect of MWCHCP. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to investigate the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression level of the intestine. Combining with cisplatin and MWCHCP caused a tendency of increasing the tumor growth inhibition rate and significant attenution of cisplatin-induced diarrhea, visceral organ injury, gastric mucosal injury and decreased TNF-alpha mRNA level of intestine. The present findings suggest that MWCHCP increases the inhibition rate of tumor growth of cisplatin and has a beneficial influence on gastrointestinal lesion induced by cisplatin.
