[Drug interactions on P-glycoprotein transport level and its application]. Potential drug interactions on P-glycoprotein transport level were discussed in this article. As an efflux transporter protein widely distributed in various tissues, P-glycoprotein plays an important role in many drugs interactions, via affecting the metabolic process to alter the concentration of drug in plasma and tissue. Interactions between herb and western drug may occur by inducing or inhibiting P-glycoprotein, resulting in either efficacy enhancement or adverse effects. So it is important for clinical drug use by rational utilization of the interaction between herb and western drug which medicated by P-glycoprotein.
