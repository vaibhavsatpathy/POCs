Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: concurrent use may blunt the response to arbutamine. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be withdrawn at least 48 hours before conducting an arbutamine-mediated stress test. Antiarrhythmic agents, class I (such as flecainide, lidocaine, or quinidine): concurrent use with arbutamine may have a proarrhythmic effect. Antidepressants (tricyclic), atropine or other anticholinergic agents, or digitalis glycosides: concurrent use with arbutamine may produce additive inotropic and/or chronotropic effects.
