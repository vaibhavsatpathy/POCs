Additive CNS depression may occur when antihistamines are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Patients receiving antihistamines should be advised against the concurrent use of other CNS depressant drugs. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines.
