PEGANONE used in combination with other drugs known to adversely affect the hematopoietic system should be avoided if possible. Considerable caution should be exercised if PEGANONE is administered concurrently with Phenurone (phenacemide) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination. A two-way interaction between the hydantoin antiepileptic, phenytoin, and the coumarin anticoagulants has been suggested. Presumably, phenytoin acts as a stimulator of coumarin metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the coumarin anticoagulants and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations. Conversely, the coumarin anticoagulants have been reported to increase the serum levels and prolong the serum half-life of phenytoin by inhibiting its metabolism. Although there is no documentation of such, a similar interaction between ethotoin and the coumarin anticoagulants may occur. Caution is therefore advised when administering PEGANONE to patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants.
