Metformin: In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of cephalexin and metformin, plasma metformin mean cmax and AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%. No information is available about the interaction of cephalexin and metformin following multiple doses of either drug. Although not observed in this study, adverse effects could potentially arise from co-administration of cephalexin and metformin by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter systems. Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking cephalexin and metformin. Probenecid: As with other b-lactams, the renal excretion of cephalexin is inhibited by probenecid. Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions As a result of administration of Keflex, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur. This has been observed with Benedict s and Fehling s solutions and also with Clinitest  tablets.
