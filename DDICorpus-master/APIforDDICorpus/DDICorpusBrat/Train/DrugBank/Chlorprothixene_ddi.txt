Chlorprothixene may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given lithium. In order to avoid lithium intoxication, lithium plasma levels should be monitored closely. If chlorprothixene is given concomitantly with opioids, the opioid dose should be reduced (by approx. 50%), because chlorprothixene amplifies the therapeutic actions and side-effects of opioids massively. Avoid the concomitant use of chlorprothixene and tramadol (Ultram). Massive seizures may be encountered with this combination. Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if chlorprothixene is given with benzodiazepines or barbituates. Choose particular low doses of these drugs. Exert particular caution in combining chlorprothixene with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
