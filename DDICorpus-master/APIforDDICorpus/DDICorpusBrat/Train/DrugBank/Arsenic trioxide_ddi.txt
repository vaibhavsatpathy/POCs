No formal assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between TRISENOX and other agents have been conducted. Caution is advised when TRISENOX is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
