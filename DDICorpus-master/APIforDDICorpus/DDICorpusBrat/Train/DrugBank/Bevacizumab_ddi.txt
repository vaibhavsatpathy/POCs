No formal drug interaction studies with anti-neoplastic agents have been conducted. In Study 1, patients with colorectal cancer were given irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin (bolus-IFL) with or without AVASTIN. Irinotecan concentrations were similar in patients receiving bolus-IFL alone and in combination with AVASTIN. The concentrations of SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, were on average 33% higher in patients receiving bolus-IFL in combination with AVASTIN when compared with bolus-IFL alone. In Study 1, patients receiving bolus-IFL plus AVASTIN had a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 diarrhea and neutropenia. Due to high inter-patient variability and limited sampling, the extent of the increase in SN38 levels in patients receiving concurrent irinotecan and AVASTIN is uncertain.
