Carbamazepine: Elevated carbamazepine levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when SUPRAX is administered concomitantly. Drug monitoring may be of assistance in detecting alterations in carbamazepine plasma concentrations. Warfarin and Anticoagulants: Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when cefixime is administered concomitantly. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside but not with those using nitroferricyanide. The administration of SUPRAX may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest **, Benedict s solution, or Fehling s solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix ** or Tes-Tape **) be used. A false-positive direct Coombs test has been reported during treatment with other cephalosporin antibiotics; therefore, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug.
