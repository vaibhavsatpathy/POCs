The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from controlled clinical trials and studies involving otherwise healthy adults with epilepsy. Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of Felbatol  to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs. The net effect of these interactions is summarized in the following table: AED AED Felbatol Coadministered Concentration Concentration Phenytoin Valproate    ** Carbamazepine (CBZ) *CBZ epoxide Phenobarbital *Not administered, but an active metabolite of carbamazepine. **No significant effect. Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: Felbatol  causes an increase in steady-state phenytoin plasma concentrations. In 10 otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy ingesting phenytoin, the steadystate trough (Cmin) phenytoin plasma concentration was 17 5 micrograms/mL. The steady-state Cmin increased to 21 5 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered. Increasing the felbamate dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state phenytoin Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL. In order to maintain phenytoin levels, limit adverse experiences, and achieve the felbamate dose of 3600 mg/day, a phenytoin dose reduction of approximately 40% was necessary for eight of these 10 subjects. In a controlled clinical trial, a 20% reduction of the phenytoin dose at the initiation of Felbatol  therapy resulted in phenytoin levels comparable to those prior to Felbatol  administration. Carbamazepine: Felbatol  causes a decrease in the steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration. In nine otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy ingesting carbamazepine, the steady-state trough (Cmin) carbamazepine concentration was 8 2 micrograms/mL. The carbamazepine steady-state Cmin decreased 31% to 5 1 micrograms/mL when felbamate (3000 mg/day, divided into three doses) was coadministered. Carbamazepine epoxide steady-state Cmin concentrations increased 57% from 1.0 0.3 to 1.6 0.4 micrograms/mL with the addition of felbamate. In clinical trials, similar changes in carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide were seen. Valproate: Felbatol  causes an increase in steady-state valproate concentrations. In four subjects with epilepsy ingesting valproate, the steady-state trough (Cmin) valproate plasma concentration was 63 16 micrograms/mL. The steady-state Cmin increased to 78 14 micrograms/mL when 1200 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate valproate Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL. Corresponding values for free valproate Cmin concentrations were 7 3, 9 4, and 11 6 micrograms/mL for 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day Felbatol , respectively. The ratios of the AUCs of unbound valproate to the AUCs of the total valproate were 11.1 %, 13.0%, and 11.5%, with coadministration of 0, 1200, and 2400 mg/day of Felbatol , respectively. Phenobarbital: Coadministration of felbamate with phenobarbital causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL. The steady-state Cmin concentration increased to 17.8 micrograms/mL when 2400 mg/day of felbamate was coadministered for one week. Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy. Valproate: Available data suggest that there is no significant effect of valproate on the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state, Therefore, the addition of valproate is not expected to cause a clinically important effect on Felbatol  (felbamate) plasma concentrations. Phenobarbital: It appears that phenobarbital may reduce plasma felbamate concentrations. Steady-state plasma felbamate concentrations were found to be 29% lower than the mean concentrations of a group of newly diagnosed subjects with epilepsy also receiving 2400 mg of felbamate a day. Effects of Antacids on Felbatol  The rate and extent of absorption of a 2400 mg dose of Felbatol  as monotherapy given as tablets was not affected when coadministered with antacids. Effects of Erythromycin on Felbatol  The coadministration of erythromycin (1000 mg/day) for 10 days did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax, Cmin, AUC, CI/kg or tmax at felbamate daily doses of 3000 or 3600 mg/day in 10 otherwise healthy subjects with epilepsy. Effects of Felbatol  on Low-Dose Combination Oral Contraceptives A group of 24 nonsmoking, healthy white female volunteers established on an oral contraceptive regimen containing 30 mg ethinyl estradiol and 75 mg gestodene for at least 3 months received 2400 mg/day of felbamate from midcycle (day 15) to midcycle (day 14) of two consecutive oral contraceptive cycles. Felbamate treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the gestodene AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol. No volunteer showed hormonal evidence of ovulation, but one volunteer reported intermenstrual bleeding during felbamate treatment.
