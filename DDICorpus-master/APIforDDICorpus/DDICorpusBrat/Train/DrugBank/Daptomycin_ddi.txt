Warfarin: Concomitant administration of daptomycin (6 mg/kg once every 24 hours for 5 days) and warfarin (25 mg single oral dose) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug, and the INR was not significantly altered. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may cause myopathy, which is manifested as muscle pain or weakness associated with elevated levels of CPK. There were no reports of skeletal myopathy in a placebo-controlled Phase I trial in which 10 healthy subjects on stable simvastatin therapy were treated concurrently with daptomycin (4 mg/kg once every 24 hours) for 14 days. Experience with co-administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and Fentanyl in patients is limited,therefore,consideration should be given to temporarily suspending use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in patients receiving Fentanyl. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions: There are no reported drug-laboratory test interactions.
