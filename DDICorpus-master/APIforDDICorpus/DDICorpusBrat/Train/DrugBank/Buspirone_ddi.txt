It is recommended that buspirone hydrochloride not be used concomitantly with MAO inhibitors Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution. There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride (Desyrel) and buspirone HCl may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients. In a similar study, attempting to replicate this finding, no interactive effect on hepatic transaminases was identified. In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of buspirone HCl and haloperidol resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations. The clinical significance of this finding is not clear. In vitro, buspirone does not displace tightly bound drugs like phenytoin, propranolol, and warfarin from serum proteins. However, there has been one report of prolonged prothrombin time when buspirone was added to the regimen of a patient treated with warfarin. The patient was also chronically receiving phenytoin, phenobarbital, digoxin, and levothyroxine sodium. In vitro, buspirone may displace less firmly bound drugs like digoxin. The clinical significance of this property is unknown.
