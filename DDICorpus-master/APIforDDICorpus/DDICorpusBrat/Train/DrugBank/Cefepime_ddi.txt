Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of aminoglycosides are to be administered with MAXIPIME because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins with potent diuretics such as furosemide. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The administration of cefepime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using Clinitest  tablets. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix  or Tes-Tape  ) be used.
