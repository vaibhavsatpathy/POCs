General In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance. Anesthetics/Sedatives/Hypnotics/Opioids: Co-administration of PRECEDEX with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with PRECEDEX, a reduction in dosage of PRECEDEX on the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required. Neuromuscular Blockers: In one study of 10 healthy volunteers, administration of PRECEDEX for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of 1 (one) ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude or neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.
