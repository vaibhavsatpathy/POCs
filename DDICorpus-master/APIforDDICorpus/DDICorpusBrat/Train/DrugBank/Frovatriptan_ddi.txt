Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Due to a theoretical risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and FROVA within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see  a href= frova_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS). Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists within 24 hours of FROVA treatment is not recommended. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been reported, rarely, to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with 5-HT1 agonists. If concomitant treatment with frovatriptan and an SSRI is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions FROVA is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests.
