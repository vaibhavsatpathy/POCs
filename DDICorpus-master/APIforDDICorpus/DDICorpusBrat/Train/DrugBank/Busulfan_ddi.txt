Itraconazole decreases busulfan clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients. Fluconazole, and the 5-HT3 antiemetics ondansetron (Zofran) and granisetron (Kytril) have all been used with BUSULFEX. Phenytoin increases the clearance of busulfan by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase. Since the pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX were studied in patients treated with phenytoin, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin. Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of acetaminophen prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with BUSULFEX may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
