Patients who are applying Panretin gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a common component of insect repellent products. Animal toxicology studies showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as proof of the formulation. Although there was no clinical evidence in the vehicle-controlled studies of drug interactions with systemic antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals, the effect of Panretin gel on the steady-state concentrations of these drugs is not known. No drug interaction data are available on concomitant administration of Panretin gel and systemic anti-KS agents.
