No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with PERSANTINE  (dipyridamole USP) Tablets. The following information was obtained from the literature. Adenosine: Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
