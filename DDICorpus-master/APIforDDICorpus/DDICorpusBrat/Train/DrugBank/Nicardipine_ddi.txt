Beta-Blockers: In controlled clinical studies, adrenergic beta-receptor blockers have been frequently administered concomitantly with nicardipine HCl. The combination is well tolerated. Cimetidine: Cimetidine increases nicardipine HCl plasma levels. Patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Digoxin: Some calcium blockers may increase the concentration of digitalis preparations in the blood. Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum digoxin levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with nicardipine HCl is initiated. Maalox * Coadministration of Maalox TC had no effect on nicardipine HCl absorption. Even though such interactions were not seen during clinical studies with nicardipine HCl, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur. Cyclosporine: Concomitant administration of nicardipine and cyclosporine levels. Plasma concentrations of cyclosporine should therefore be closely monitored, and its dosage reduced accordingly, in patients treated with nicardipine. When therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma (in vitro), the plasma protein binding of nicardipine HCl was not altered.
