No drug-drug interaction studies in human subjects have been conducted. Toxicologic and toxicokinetic studies in rats did not demonstrate any alterations in the clearance or toxicologic profile of either methotrexate or Kineret when the two agents were administered together. In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent Kineret and etanercept therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with etanercept alone (0%). Two percent of patients treated concurrently with Kineret and etanercept developed neutropenia (ANC  1 x 109/L).
