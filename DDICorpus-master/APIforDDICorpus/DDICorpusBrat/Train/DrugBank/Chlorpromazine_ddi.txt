The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia. Interactions may also occur with the following: anti-depressants/anti-anxiety drugs, drugs used to treat an overactive thyroid, beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol), sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, guanethidine, guanadrel, metrizamide, cabergoline, lithium, narcotic pain medication (e.g., codeine), drugs used to aid sleep, drowsiness-causing antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), any other drugs that may make you drowsy.
