Cytosine arabinoside, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of flucytosine by competitive inhibition. Drugs which impair glomerular filtration may prolong the biological half-life of flucytosine. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Measurement of serum creatinine levels should be determined by the Jaffe reaction, since Ancobon does not interfere with the determination of creatinine values by this method. Most automated equipment for measurement of creatinine makes use of the Jaffe reaction.
