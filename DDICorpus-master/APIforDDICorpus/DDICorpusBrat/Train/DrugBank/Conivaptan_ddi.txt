Digoxin: Coadministration of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate, with oral conivaptan resulted in a reduction in clearance and an increase in digoxin Cmax and AUC values. Therefore, if digoxin is administered with VAPRISOL, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increases in digoxin levels.
