and/or Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions. Effect of Sensipar on other drugs: Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6): Sensipar  is a strong in vitro inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, dose adjustments of concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., flecainide, vinblastine, thioridazine and most tricyclic antidepressants) may be required. Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg cinacalcet with 50 mg amitriptyline increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. Effect of other drugs on Sensipar : Sensipar  is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. Ketoconazole: Sensipar is metabolized in part by CYP3A4. Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased cinacalcet exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold. Dose adjustment of Sensipar may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, itraconazole; see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
