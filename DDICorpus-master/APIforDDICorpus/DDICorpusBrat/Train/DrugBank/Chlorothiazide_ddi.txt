When given concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. - Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of otthostatic hypotension may occur . - Antidiabetic drugs: (Oral agents and insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required . - Other antihypertensive drugs: Additive effect or potentiation . - Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and colestipol resins have the potential of binding thiazide diuretics and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract . - Corticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia . - Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine): Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use . - Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine): Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant . - Lithium: Generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with chlorothiazide . - Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when chlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained . - Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.
