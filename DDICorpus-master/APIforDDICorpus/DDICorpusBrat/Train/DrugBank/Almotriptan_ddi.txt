Ergot-Containing Drugs: These drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and AXERT within 24 hours of each other should be avoided. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Coadministration of moclobemide resulted in a 27% decrease in almotriptan clearance and an increase in Cmax of approximately 6%. No dose adjustment is necessary. Other 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists within 24 hours of treatment with AXERT is contraindicated. Propanolol: The pharmacokinetics of almotriptan were not affected by coadministration of propranolol. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with 5-HT1 agonists. If concomitant treatment with AXERT and an SSRI is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Verapamil: Coadministration of almotriptan and verapamil resulted in a 24% increase in plasma concentrations of almotriptan. No dose adjustment is necessary. Coadministration of almotriptan and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg q.d. for 3 days) resulted in an approximately 60% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximal plasma concentrations of almotriptan. Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ritonavir, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when almotriptan is used concomitantly with these medications. AXERT is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests.
