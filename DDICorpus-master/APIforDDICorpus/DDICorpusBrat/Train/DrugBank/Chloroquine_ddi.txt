Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided. Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. An interval of at least two hours between intake of this agent and chloroquine should be observed. Cyclosporin: After introduction of chloroquine (oral form), a sudden increase in serum cyclosporin level has been reported. Therefore, close monitoring of serum cyclosporin level is recommended and, if necessary, chloroquine should be discontinued.
