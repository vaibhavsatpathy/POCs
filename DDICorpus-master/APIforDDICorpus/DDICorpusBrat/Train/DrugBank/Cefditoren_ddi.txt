Oral Contraceptives Multiple doses of cefditoren pivoxil had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol, the estrogenic component in most oral contraceptives. Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that cefditoren pivoxil be taken concomitantly with antacids. H2-Receptor Antagonists: Co-administration of a single dose of intravenously administered famotidine (20 mg) reduced the oral absorption of a single 400 mg dose of cefditoren pivoxil administered following a meal, as evidenced by a 27% decrease in mean Cmax and a 22% decrease in mean AUC. Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that cefditoren pivoxil be taken concomitantly with H2 receptor antagonists. Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, co-administration of probenecid with cefditoren pivoxil resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Cephalosporins are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs test. A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (Benedicts or Fehlings solution or with CLINITEST tablets), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria (e.g., CLINISTIX, TES-TAPE). As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefditoren pivoxil.
