Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether similar increases will occur in patients given oral H2-antagonists is unknown; no other specific drug interaction studies were performed. Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of alendronate.
