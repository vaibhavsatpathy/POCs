Effects of Other Drugs on Aliskiren Based on in-vitro studies, aliskiren is metabolized by CYP 3A4. Co-administration of lovastatin, atenolol, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, celecoxib, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, valsartan, metformin and amlodipine did not result in clinically significant increases in aliskiren exposure. Co-administration of irbesartan reduced aliskiren Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing. Co-administration of atorvastatin resulted in about a 50% increase in aliskiren Cmax and AUC after multiple dosing. Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily ketoconazole with aliskiren resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren. A 400 mg once-daily dose was not studied but would be expected to increase aliskiren blood levels further. Effects of Aliskiren on Other Drugs Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and CYP 3A) or induce CYP 3A4. Co-administration of aliskiren did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin, digoxin, valsartan, amlodipine, metformin, celecoxib, atenolol, atorvastatin, ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide. Warfarin: The effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in a well-controlled clinical trial. Furosemide: When aliskiren was co-administered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
