Metoclopramide: When coadministered with MONUROL, metoclopramide, a drug which increases gastrointestinal motility, lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of fosfomycin. Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects. Cimetidine: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin when coadministered with MONUROL.
