Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions As with cephalothin, high concentrations of cefoxitin ( 100 micrograms/mL) may interfere with measurement of serum and urine creatinine levels by the Jaff  reaction, and produce false increases of modest degree in the levels of creatinine reported. Serum samples from patients treated with cefoxitin should not be analyzed for creatinine if withdrawn within 2 hours of drug administration. High concentrations of cefoxitin in the urine may interfere with measurement of urinary 17-hydroxy-corticosteroids by the Porter-Silber reaction, and produce false increases of modest degree in the levels reported. A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur. This has been observed with CLINITEST  reagent tablets . Registered trademark of Ames Company, Division of Miles Laboratories, Inc.
