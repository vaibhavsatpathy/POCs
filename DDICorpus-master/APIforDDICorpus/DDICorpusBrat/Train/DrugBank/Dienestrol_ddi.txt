Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions Certain endocrine and liver function tests may be affected by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The following similar changes may be expected with larger doses of estrogen: - Increased sulfobromophthalein retention . - Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability . - Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to in-creased circulating total thyroid hormone; as measured by PBI, T4 by column, or T4 by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered . - Impaired glucose tolerance . - Decreased pregnanediol excretion . - Reduced response to metyrapone test . - Reduced serum folate concentration . - Increased serum triglyceride and phospholipid concentration.
