In vitro, nilutamide has been shown to inhibit the activity of liver cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and therefore, may reduce the metabolism of compounds requiring these systems. Consequently, drugs with a low therapeutic margin, such as vitamin K antagonists, phenytoin, and theophylline, could have a delayed elimination and increases in their serum half-life leading to a toxic level. The dosage of these drugs or others with a similar metabolism may need to be modified if they are administered concomitantly with nilutamide. For example, when vitamin K antagonists are administered concomitantly with nilutamide, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.
