Aminosalicylic acid may decrease the amount of digoxin (Lanoxin, Lanoxicaps) that gets absorbed into your body. In the case that you are taking digoxin while taking aminosalicylic acid, higher doses of digoxin may be needed. Aminosalicylic acid may also decrease the absorption of vitamin B12, which can lead to a deficiency. Therefore you may need to take a vitamin B12 supplement while taking aminosalicylic acid.
