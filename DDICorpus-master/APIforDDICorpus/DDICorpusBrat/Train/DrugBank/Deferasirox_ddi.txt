The concomitant administration of Exjade and aluminum-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, Exjade should not be taken with aluminum-containing antacid preparations. In healthy volunteers, Exjade had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The effect of digoxin on Exjade pharmacokinetics has not been studied. The concomitant administration of Exjade and vitamin C has not been formally studied. Doses of vitamin C up to 200 mg were allowed in clinical studies without negative consequences. The interaction of Exjade with hydroxyurea has not been formally studied. No inhibition of deferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea is expected based on the results of an in vitro study. Exjade should not be combined with other iron chelator therapies, as safety of such combinations has not been established. Drug/Food Interactions The bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox was variably increased when taken with a meal. Deferasirox should be taken on an empty stomach 30 minutes before eating. Exjade tablets for oral suspension can be dispersed in water, orange juice, or apple juice.
