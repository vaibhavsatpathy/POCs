FLUOTHANE augments the action of non-depolarising muscle relaxants and the muscle relaxant effects of aminoglycosides. FLUOTHANE may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of tubocurarine. Caution should be exercised during the administration of adrenaline to patients anaesthetised with FLUOTHANE as arrhythmias may be precipitated. For this reason the dose of adrenaline should be restricted and an antiarrhythmic agent administered as appropriate. Caution should also be applied for other sympathomimetics, and for aminophylline and theophylline and tricyclic antidepressants, which may also precipitate arrhythmias.
