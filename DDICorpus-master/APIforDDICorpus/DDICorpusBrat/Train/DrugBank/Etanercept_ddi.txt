Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ENBREL . However, it was observed that the pharmacokinetics of ENBREL  was unaltered by concomitant methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent ENBREL  and anakinra therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with ENBREL  alone (0%). Two percent of patients treated concurrently with ENBREL  and anakinra developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L). Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with sulfasalazine, to which ENBREL was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either ENBREL CI or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.
