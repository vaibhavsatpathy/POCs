Interactions between COPAXONE  and other drugs have not been fully evaluated. Results from existing clinical trials suggest no significant interactions between COPAXONE  and other therapies commonly used in MS patients, including the concurrent use of corticosteroids for up to 28 days. COPAXONE  has not been formally evaluated in combination with Interferon beta. However, 10 patients who switched from therapy with Interferon beta to COPAXONE  did not report any serious and unexpected adverse reactions thought to be related to treatment.
