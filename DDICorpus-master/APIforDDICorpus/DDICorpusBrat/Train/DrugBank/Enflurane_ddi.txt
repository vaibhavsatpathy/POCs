The action of nondepolarizing relaxants is augmented by Enflurane. Less than the usual amounts of these medicines should be used. If the usual amounts of nondepolarizing relaxants are given, the time for recovery from neuromuscular blockade will be longer in the presence of Enflurane than when halothane or nitrous oxide with a balanced technique are used.
