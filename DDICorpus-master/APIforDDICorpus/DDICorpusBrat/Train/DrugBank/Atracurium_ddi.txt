Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of TRACRIUM include: enflurane; isoflurane; halothane; certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins; lithium; magnesium salts; procainamide; Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of TRACRIUM include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine. If other muscle relaxants are used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonist effect should be considered. The prior administration of succinylcholine does not enhance the duration, but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of neuromuscular block induced by TRACRIUM. TRACRIUM should not be administered until a patient has recovered from succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular block.
