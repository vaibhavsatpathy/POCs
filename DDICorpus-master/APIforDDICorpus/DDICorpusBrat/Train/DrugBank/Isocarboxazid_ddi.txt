Isocarboxazid should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse (disulfiram, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). In a single study, rats given high intraperitoneal doses of an MAO inhibitor plus disulfiram experienced severe toxicity, including convulsions and death. Concomitant use of Isocarboxazid and other psychotropic agents is generally not recommended because of possible potentiating effects. This is especially true in patients who may subject themselves to an overdosage of drugs. If combination therapy is needed, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of all agents to be used. The monoamine oxidase inhibitory effects of Isocarboxazid may persist for a substantial period after discontinuation of the drug, and this should be borne in mind when another drug is prescribed following Isocarboxazid. To avoid potentiation, the physician wishing to terminate treatment with Isocarboxazid and begin therapy with another agent should allow for an interval of 10 days.
