Use of MAO inhibitors may cause an excessive increase in blood pressure and heart stimulation. If you are also using a steroid inhaler, take bitolterol first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler. This allows bitolterol to open air passages, increasing the effectiveness of the steroid.
