Formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ORENCIA. Population pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that MTX, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and TNF blocking agents did not influence abatacept clearance. The majority of patients in RA clinical studies received one or more of the following concomitant medications with ORENCIA: MTX, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, TNF blocking agents, azathioprine, chloroquine, gold, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and anakinra. Concurrent administration of a TNF antagonist with ORENCIA has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and no significant additional efficacy over use of the TNF antagonists alone. Concurrent therapy with ORENCIA and TNF antagonists is not recommended. There is insufficient experience to assess the safety and efficacy of ORENCIA administered concurrently with anakinra, and therefore such use is not recommended.
