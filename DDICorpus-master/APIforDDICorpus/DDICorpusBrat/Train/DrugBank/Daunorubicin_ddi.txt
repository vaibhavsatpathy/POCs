Use of Cerubidine in a patient who has previously received doxorubicin increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Cerubidine should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or Cerubidine. Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with Cerubidine may also result in increased cardiotoxicity. Dosage reduction of Cerubidine may be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents. Hepatotoxic medications, such as high-dose methotrexate, may impair liver function and increase the risk of toxicity.
