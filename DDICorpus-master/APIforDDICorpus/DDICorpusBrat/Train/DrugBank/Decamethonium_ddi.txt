Potentially fatal drug interactions may occur when coadministered with digoxin, as this may enhance cardiovascular depression and bradyarrhythmias may occur. Anticholinesterases (neostgmine, physostigmine), lignocaine, quinine, procainamide can enhance toxicity and cause cardio respiratory depression. In addition, neuromuscular blocking action is enhanced by general anesthetics, local anesthetics like lidocaine, procaine, beta-blockers, metaclopramide, lithium carbonate, and terbutaline.
