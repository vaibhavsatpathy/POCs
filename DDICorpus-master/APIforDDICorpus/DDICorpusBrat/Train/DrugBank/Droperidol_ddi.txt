Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with INAPSINE. When patients have received such drugs, the dose of INAPSINE required will be less than usual. Following the administration of INAPSINE, the dose of other CNS depressant drugs should be reduced.
