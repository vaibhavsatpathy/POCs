Known drug interactions include barbiturates, tranquilizers, and alcohol. Diphenoxylate HCl and atropine sulfate may interact with MAO inhibitors In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Therefore, diphenoxylate has the potential to prolong the biological half-lives of drugs for which the rate of elimination is dependent on the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system.
