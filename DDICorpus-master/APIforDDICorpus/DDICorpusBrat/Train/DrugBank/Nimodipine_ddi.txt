It is possible that the cardiovascular action of other calcium channel blockers could be enhanced by the addition of Nimotop . In Europe, Nimotop  was observed to occasionally intensify the effect of antihypertensive compounds taken concomitantly by patients suffering from hypertension; this phenomenon was not observed in North American clinical trials. A study in eight healthy volunteers has shown a 50% increase in mean peak nimodipine plasma concentrations and a 90% increase in mean area under the curve, after a one week course of cimetidine at 1,000 mg/day and nimodipine at 90 mg/day. This effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 by cimetidine, which could decrease first pass metabolism of nimodipine.
