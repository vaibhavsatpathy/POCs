Concurrent administration of etanercept (another TNF -blocking agent) and anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone. Other TNFa-blocking agents (including REMICADE) used in combination with anakinra may also result in similar toxicities. Specific drug interaction studies, including interactions with MTX, have not been conducted. The majority of patients in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn s disease clinical studies received one or more concomitant medications. In rheumatoid arthritis, concomitant medications besides MTX were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, folic acid, corticosteroids and/or narcotics. Concomitant Crohn s disease medications were antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, 6-MP/AZA and aminosalicylates. In psoriatic arthritis clinical trials, concomitant medications included MTX in approximately half of the patients as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, folic acid and corticosteroids. Patients with Crohn s disease who received immunosuppressants tended to experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients on no immunosuppressants. Serum infliximab concentrations appeared to be unaffected by baseline use of medications for the treatment of Crohn s disease including corticosteroids, antibiotics (metronidazole or ciprofloxacin) and aminosalicylates.
