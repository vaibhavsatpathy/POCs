Uricosuric Agents: Aspirin may decrease the effects of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone. Alcohol: Has a synergistic effect with aspirin in causing gastrointestinal bleeding. Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels. Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents: Aspirin is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Urinary Alkalinizers: Decrease aspirin effectiveness by increasing the rate of salicylate renal excretion. Phenobarbital: Decreases aspirin effectiveness by enzyme induction. Phenytoin: Serum phenytoin levels may be increased by aspirin. Propranolol: May decrease aspirins anti-inflammatory action by competing for the same receptors. Antacids: Enteric Coated Aspirin should not be given concurrently with antacids, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
