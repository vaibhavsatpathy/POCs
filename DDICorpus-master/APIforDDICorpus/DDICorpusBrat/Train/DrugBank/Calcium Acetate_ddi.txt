Concomitant use with other calcium-containing medicines (including antacids) may cause too much calcium in the blood or urine, which may increase the chance of side effects. Using calcium acetate with digitalis glycosides (heart medicine) may cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), which could increase the chance of developing an irregular heartbeat.
