Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for the human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible ( 1%), interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected.
