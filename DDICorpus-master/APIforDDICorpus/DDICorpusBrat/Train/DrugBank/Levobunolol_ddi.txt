Although BETAGAN used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with BETAGAN and epinephrine may occur. Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension. Patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents along with either oral or intravenous calcium antagonists should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, simultaneous use should be avoided altogether. The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects on prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. Phenothiazine-related compounds and beta-adrenergic blocking agents may have additive hypotensite effects due to the inhibition of each other s metabolism.
