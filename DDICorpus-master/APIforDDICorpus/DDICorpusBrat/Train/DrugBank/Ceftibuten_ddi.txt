Theophylline: Twelve healthy male volunteers were administered one 200-mg ceftibuten capsule twice daily for 6 days. With the morning dose of ceftibuten on day 6, each volunteer received a single intravenous infusion of theophylline (4 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetics of theophylline were not altered. The effect of ceftibuten on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered orally has not been investigated. Antacids or H 2 -receptor antagonists: The effect of increased gastric pH on the bioavailability of ceftibuten was evaluated in 18 healthy adult volunteers. Each volunteer was administered one 400-mg ceftibuten capsule. A single dose of liquid antacid did not affect the C max or AUC of ceftibuten; however, 150 mg of ranitidine q12h for 3 days increased the ceftibuten C max by 23% and ceftibuten AUC by 16%. The clinical relevance of these increases is not known. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: There have been no chemical or laboratory test interactions with ceftibuten noted to date. False-positive direct Coombs tests have been reported during treatment with other cephalosporins. Therefore, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test could be due to the drug. The results of assays using red cells from healthy subjects to determine whether ceftibuten would cause direct Coombs reactions in vitro showed no positive reaction at ceftibuten concentrations as high as 40  g/mL.
