LABORATORY TEST FINDINGS Asymptomatic, transitory changes in serum iron have been observed. The clinical significance is unknown. Omniscan interferes with serum calcium measurements with some colorimetric (complexometric) methods commonly used in hospitals, resulting in serum calcium concentrations lower than the true values. Thus, it is recommended not to use such methods for 12-24 hours after administration of Omniscan. If such measurements are necessary, the use of other methods is recommended. All patients in whom this effect was observed remained asymptomatic.
