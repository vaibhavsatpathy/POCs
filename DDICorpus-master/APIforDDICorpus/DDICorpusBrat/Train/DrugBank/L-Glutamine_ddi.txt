Human growth hormone - Concomitant use of L-glutamine and human growth hormone may enhance nutrient absorption in those with severe short bowel syndrome. L-glutamine has orphan drug status for this indication. Indomethacin - Concomitant use of L-glutamine and indomethacin may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin. The reported dose used for L-glutamine was 21 grams daily taken in divided doses three times a day. Further, misoprostol is reported to have a synergistic effect with this combination in ameliorating intestinal permeability. Methotrexate - There is one report that methotrexate may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental L-glutamine for chemotherapy-induced mucositis. In another report, nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of methotrexate-related toxicity when given supplemental L-glutamine at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day. Paclitaxel - In one report, L-glutamine at a dose of 10 grams three times daily, given 24 hours after receiving paclitaxel, appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia, adverse reactions of paclitaxel.
