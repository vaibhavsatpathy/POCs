Methotrexate: HUMIRA has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking concomitant MTX. The data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either HUMIRA or MTX. Anakinra: Concurrent administration of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocking agent has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone. The safety and efficacy of anakinra used in combination with HUMIRA has not been studied. Therefore the, combination of anakinra with other TNF-blocking agents, including HUMIRA, may also result i n similar toxicities.
