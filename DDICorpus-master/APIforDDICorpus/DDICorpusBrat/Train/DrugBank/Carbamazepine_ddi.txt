Clinically meaningful drug interactions have occurred with concomitant medications and include, but are not limited to the following: Agents Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Carbamazepine is not highly bound to plasma proteins; therefore, administration of EQUETROTM to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound should not cause increased free concentrations of the other drug. Agents that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes and/or Epoxide Hydrolase Carbamazepine is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to the active carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide, which is further metabolized to the trans-diol by epoxide hydrolase. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that inhibits CYP3A4 and/or epoxide hydrolase. Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of EQUETROTM are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for EQUETROTM may be necessary. Agents that Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that induces CYP3A4. Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of EQUETROTM are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary. Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Carbamazepine is known to induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent metabolized by one (or more) of these enzymes. Agents that have been found, or are expected to have decreased plasma levels in the presence of EQUETROTM due to induction of CYP enzymes are the following: Acetaminophen, alprazolam, amitriptyline, bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, cyclosporin, delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, doxycycline, ethosuximide, felbamate, felodipine, glucocorticoids, haloperidol, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, midazolam, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral contraceptives(3), oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin(4), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, theophylline, topiramate, tiagabine, tramadol, triazolam, valproate, warfarin(5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: EQUETROTM increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Given the anticonvulsant properties of carbamazepine, EQUETROTM may reduce the thyroid function as has been reported with other anticonvulsants. Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when EQUETROTM is taken with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.
