Angiomax does not exhibit binding to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or red blood cells. In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of Angiomax with heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications. There is no experience with co-administration of Angiomax and plasma expanders such as dextran. Angiomax should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Immunogenicity/Re-exposure: In in vitro studies, Angiomax exhibited no platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of HIT/HITTS. Among 494 subjects who received Angiomax in clinical trials and were tested for antibodies, 2 subjects had treatment-emergent positive bivalirudin antibody tests. Neither subject demonstrated clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions and repeat testing was not performed. Nine additional patients who had initial positive tests were negative on repeat testing.
