Increases in serum creatinine have occurred when CEFOTAN was given alone. If CEFOTAN and an aminoglycoside are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: The administration of CEFOTAN may result in a false positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest  , Benedicts solution, or Fehlings solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase be used. As with other cephalosporins, high concentrations of cefotetan may interfere with measurement of serum and urine creatinine levels by Jaffe  reaction and produce false increases in the levels of creatinine reported.
