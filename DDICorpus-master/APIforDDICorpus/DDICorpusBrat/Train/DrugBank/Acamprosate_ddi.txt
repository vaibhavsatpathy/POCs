The concomitant intake of alcohol and Acamprosate does not affect the pharmacokinetics of either alcohol or acamprosate. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that administration of disulfiram or diazepam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of acamprosate. Co-administration of naltrexone with Acamprosate produced a 25% increase in AUC and a 33% increase in the Cmax of acamprosate. No adjustment of dosage is recommended in such patients. The pharmacokinetics of naltrexone and its major metabolite 6-beta-naltrexol were unaffected following co-administration with Acamprosate. Other concomitant therapies: In clinical trials, the safety profile in subjects treated with Acamprosate concomitantly with anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives (including benzodiazepines), or non-opioid analgesics was similar to that of subjects taking placebo with these concomitant medications. Patients taking Acamprosate concomitantly with antidepressants more commonly reported both weight gain and weight loss, compared with patients taking either medication alone.
