Vasoconstrictors: D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used with peripheral vasoconstrictors because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure. Sumatriptan: Sumatriptan has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP. Sumatriptan and D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other.. Beta Blockers: Although the results of a clinical study did not indicate a safe problem associated with the administration of D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP to subjects already receiving propranolol, there have been reports that propranolol may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine. Nicotine: Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy. Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the macrolide class, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction. Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of ergotamine-containing drugs when co-administered with these antibiotics. SSRIs: Weakness hyperreflexia, and incoordination have been reported rarely when 5-HT1 agonists have been co-administered with SSRIs (e. g. fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline). There have been no reported cases from spontaneous reports of drug interaction between SSRIs and D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP. Oral Contraceptives: The effect of oral contraceptives on the pharmacokinetics of D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP has not been studied.
