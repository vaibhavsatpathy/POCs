Atovaquone is highly bound to plasma protein (99.9%). Therefore, caution should be used when administering MEPRON concurrently with other highly plasma protein- bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur. The extent of plasma protein binding of atovaquone in human plasma is not affected by the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin (15 mcg/ mL), nor is the binding of phenytoin affected by the presence of atovaquone. Rifampin: Coadministration of rifampin and MEPRON Suspension results in a significant decrease in average steady- state plasma atovaquone concentrations. Alternatives to rifampin should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with MEPRON. Rifabutin, another rifamycin, is structurally similar to rifampin and may possibly have some of the same drug interactions as rifampin. No interaction trials have been conducted with MEPRON and rifabutin. Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions: It is not known if MEPRON interferes with clinical laboratory test or assay results.
