Ethoxzolamide may increase the action of tricyclics, amphetamines, procainamide, and quinidine. It may increase excretion of barbiturates, lithium, and ASA and may also increase the toxicity of salicylates. Coadministration of ethoxzolamide with other diuretics, amphotericin B, and corticosteroids may cause hypokalemia.
