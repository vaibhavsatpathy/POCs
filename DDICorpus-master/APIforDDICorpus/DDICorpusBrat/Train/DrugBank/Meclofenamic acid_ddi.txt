Warfarin: Meclofenamate sodium enhances the effect of warfarin. Therefore, when meclofenamate sodium is given to a patient receiving warfarin, the dosage of warfarin should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time. Aspirin: Concurrent administration of aspirin may lower meclofenamate sodium plasma levels, possibly by competing for protein-binding sites. The urinary excretion of meclofenamate sodium is unaffected by aspirin, indicating no change in meclofenamate sodium absorption. Meclofenamate sodium does not affect serum salicylate levels. Greater fecal blood loss results from concomitant administration of both drugs than from either drug alone. Propoxyphene: The concurrent administration of propoxyphene hydrochloride does not affect the bioavailability of meclofenamate sodium. Antacids: Concomitant administration of aluminum and magnesium hydroxides does not interfere with absorption of meclofenamate sodium.
