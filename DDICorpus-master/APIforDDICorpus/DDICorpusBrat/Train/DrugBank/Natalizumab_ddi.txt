After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (AVONEX  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced TYSABRI  clearance by approximately 30%. The similarity of the TYSABRI -associated adverse event profile between Study 1 (without co-administered AVONEX ) and Study 2 (with co-administered AVONEX ) indicates that this alteration in clearance does not necessitate reduction of the TYSABRI  dose to maintain safety, General). Results of studies in multiple sclerosis patients taking TYSABRI  and concomitant interferon beta-1a (AVONEX  30 mcg IM once weekly) or glatiramer acetate were inconclusive with regard to the need for dose adjustment of the beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate.
