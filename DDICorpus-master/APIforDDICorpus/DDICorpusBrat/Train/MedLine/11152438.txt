Activity of buforin II alone and in combination with azithromycin and minocycline against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture. The in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity of buforin II alone and in combination with azithromycin and minocycline was investigated. Buforin II showed moderate activity, which increased with increasing concentration to 55.7% suppression of growth at 20 microM. Moreover, its activity was enhanced when it was combined with either azithromycin or minocycline with 90% parasite reduction at the highest concentration tested. Buforin II may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either azithromycin or minocycline.
