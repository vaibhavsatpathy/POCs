Neurochemical and functional consequences following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and methamphetamine. The neurochemical and functional consequences following MPTP administration to the rat were evaluated and compared to similar effects following methamphetamine administration. It was observed that MPTP induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by pargyline pretreatment. The MPTP-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of apomorphine in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm. Methamphetamine, like MPTP, produced depletions of striatal dopamine but these actions were potentiated by pargyline pretreatment. These observations are discussed in reference to possible deleterious effects following the administration of pargyline to patients with Parkinson's Disease.
