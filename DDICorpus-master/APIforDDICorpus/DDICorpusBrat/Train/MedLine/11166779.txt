Effects of etofibrate upon the metabolism of chylomicron-like emulsions in patients with coronary artery disease. Slow chylomicron intravascular catabolism has been associated with coronary artery disease and screening for drugs that can speed-up this process can be important. In this study, the effects of etofibrate upon chylomicron metabolism was tested by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patients with coronary artery disease, aged 59+/-11 years, (total cholesterol: 240+/-41 mg/dl; triglycerides: 188+/-42 mg/dl) submitted to a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day etofibrate or placebo for 1-month. A 1-month washout period was inserted between the treatment periods. Patients were intravenously injected a chylomicron-like emulsion doubly labeled with 14C-cholesteryl oleate and 3H-triolein at baseline and after treatments. After etofibrate treatment, there was decrease of total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels and a trend to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels. Etofibrate elicited 62% enhancement of post-heparin lipolytic activity and 100% increase of 3H-triglyceride fractional clearance rate compared with placebo treatment. 14C-cholesterol ester fractional clearance rate was 260% greater after etofibrate than after placebo. Therefore, a potent effect of etofibrate on both chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal was achieved, indicating that this drug can be used to improve this metabolism in future prospective studies.
