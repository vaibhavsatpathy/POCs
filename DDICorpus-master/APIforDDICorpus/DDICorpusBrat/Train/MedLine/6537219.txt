Hypothermia as an index of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction in the rat. Decreased core temperature in female rats was investigated as one possible index of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER). Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when ethanol was administered to rats treated with disulfiram 8 hours before the ethanol challenge. The decrease in temperature began within 20 minutes after ethanol administration, reaching a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minutes post ethanol. The core temperature returned to normal 300 minutes after ethanol. The blood pressure (carotid cannulation) decreased along with the core temperature. Maximal hypotension was found 120 minutes post ethanol, and returned to normal 300 minutes after ethanol. Heart rate increased initially and returned to normal 40 minutes after ethanol challenge.
