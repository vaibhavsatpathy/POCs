[Quantitative approach to treatment with incisive neuroleptics by therapeutic monitoring]; The problems encountered during the longterm treatment of psychotic patients with neuroleptics are illustrated by six typical case reports. A group of patients who had had a new acute episode despite seemingly adequate treatment were selected. In these six cases it was demonstrated that the neuroleptics dosage was inappropriate, being either too high or too low as judged from the plasma concentrations. Ways of improving the adequacy of the treatment of psychotic patients with neuroleptics are discussed.
