Note: dissolution of aerosol particles of budesonide in Survanta, a model lung surfactant. The effect of a pulmonary surfactant extract from bovine lung, Survanta, on the dissolution rate of aerosol particles of budesonide was determined. Aerosol particles of budesonide were generated from an ethanol solution, dried, and collected by a cascade impactor for characterization or by a liquid impinger for dissolution experiments. Powder x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the aerosol particles and starting material. No change in phase was detected, although the aerosol particles appeared to contain residual solvent. The dissolution rate of the aerosol particles in saline was low and variable. Survanta increased the extent of dissolution of budesonide in proportion to the added concentration, which was also verified by equilibrium solubilization studies. Survanta also increased rate of dissolution, in a manner similar to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Analysis of the concentration of budesonide following ultracentrifugation indicated that there is rapid equilibration of budesonide between the Survanta and aqueous phase. These results show that lung surfactant has the potential of enhancing the rate and extent of dissolution of drugs administered to the lung.
