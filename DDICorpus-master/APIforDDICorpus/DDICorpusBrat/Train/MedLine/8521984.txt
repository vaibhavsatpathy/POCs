[A pharmacological analysis of the effect of angiotensin on stimulated gastric secretion] Chronic experiments on dogs with gastric fistulas were carried out to study the influence of angiotensin 1 and angiotensin 2 on pentagastrin- and histamine-induced gastric acid secretion. It was established that both angiotensins inhibited gastric acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin but not by histamine. Comparative analysis of the effects of stimulation and inhibition of cholino- and adrenoreceptors on this inhibitory action of angiotensins suggested the mediation of angiotensin influence through the modulation of cholinergic reactions of parietal cells in the stomach.
