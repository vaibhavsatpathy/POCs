Spermine promotes the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the microsomal fraction of rat liver and it enhances the effects of oleate in this respect. Spermine (0.5-2 mM) promoted the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction in a cell-free system derived from rat liver. By contrast, spermidine (1 mM) and putrescine (1 mM) had no significant effect on the translocation when added alone. Spermine, and to a lesser extent, spermidine, enhanced the translocating action of oleate and increased its effectiveness in transferring the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction. It is proposed that the phosphohydrolase becomes metabolically active when it combines with membranes and that polyamines might help to regulate this interaction. This could facilitate the action of fatty acids and enable cells to increase their capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis to match an increased availability of fatty acids.
