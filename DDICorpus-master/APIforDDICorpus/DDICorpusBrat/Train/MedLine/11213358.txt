Influence of estradiol and progesterone on the sensitivity of rat thoracic aorta to noradrenaline. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low and high doses of estradiol, and of progesterone on the response to noradrenaline in rat thoracic aorta. Two weeks after bilateral ovariectomy, female rats received a s.c. injection of vehicle (corn oil, 0.1 mL/day), estradiol (10 microg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day) and/or progesterone (20 mg/kg/day), for eight days. On the ninth day, the rats were sacrificed and aortic rings, with or without endothelium, were used to generate concentration-response curves to noradrenaline. Aortic rings with intact endothelium from the high-dose (4 mg/kg/day) estradiol group were supersensitive to noradrenaline compared to the vehicle or low-dose (10 microg/kg/day) estradiol groups (pD2 values = 7.86+/-0.09, 7.30+/-0.11 and 7.35+/-0.04, respectively). Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high-estradiol rats were supersensitive to noradrenaline when compared to vehicle-, progesterone- and progesterone + high-estradiol-treated rats (pD2 values = 7.77+/-0.12, 7.21+/-0.13, 6.93+/-0.04 and 7.22+/-0.18, respectively). There were no significant differences among the pD2 values for noradrenaline in aortic rings without endothelium. Both of these effects were endothelium-dependent.
