Drug interactions: How to identify them. Interactions between theraputic agents have been recognized as increasingly important causes of drug at their usual recommended dose may, under certain conditions, produce toxicity of life-endangering proportions. While the recognition of drug toxicity resulting from interactions is of importance to all physciains, it is especially so for the clinician responsible for the welfare of those in the aerospace environment. This paper attempts to provide a basis for the understanding and identifications of important drug interactions. Guidelines are provided to assist the clinician in his logical approach to the identification of drug interactions when serious drug toxicity is encountered in a pateint. Only with knowledge of the interaction can the therapeutic regimen be altered so as to provide therapeutic levels of necessary drugs while avoiding toxicity.
