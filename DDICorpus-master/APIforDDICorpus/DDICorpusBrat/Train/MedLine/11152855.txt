Effect of dofetillide on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The effect of dofetilide on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study. Five days of dofetilide treatment did not significantly affect steady-state pharmacokinetic variables of digoxin compared with placebo; therefore, the use of dofetilide does not necessitate an adjustment in digoxin dose to maintain therapeutic digoxin levels.
