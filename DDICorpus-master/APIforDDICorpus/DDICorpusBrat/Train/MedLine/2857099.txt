[The GABA-ergic system and brain edema] It has been shown in rats with experimental toxic and traumatic edemas that picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) removes the antiedematous action of diazepam, phenazepam, phenibut and amizyl and reduces the action of phentolamine. When the dose of picrotoxin is minimized to 0.5 mg/kg such an effect is not observed. Prolonged daily administration of picrotoxin in a dose of 1 mg/kg results in the development of brain edema. It is recommended that GABA-positive drugs be included into a complex of treatment measures for edema.
