Vancomycin resistance reversal in enterococci by flavonoids. The development of clinical vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci (VRE) is a major cause for concern. Here we show that a combination of galangin or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone with vancomycin may be used to sensitize resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium to the level of vancomycin-sensitive strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and viable counts were determined in Iso-sensitest broth using a microtitre method. MICs of vancomycin against 67% of resistant clinical isolates and a type strain of enterococci were lowered from > 250 microg mL(-1) to 1 4 microg mL(-1) in the presence of galangin (12.5 microg mL(-1)) or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone (6.25 microg mL(-1)). Viable counts for type culture E. faecalis ATCC 51299 showed the flavonoids alone significantly lowered numbers of colony forming units (CFUs). CFUs were maintained at low levels (10(3) CFU mL(-1)) for 24 h by vancomycin/flavone combinations. This combinational action in reversing vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlights novel drug targets and has importance in the design of new therapeutic regimes against resistant pathogens.
