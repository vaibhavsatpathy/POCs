Acute hydrocortisone administration does not affect subjective responses to d-amphetamine in humans. RATIONALE: Stress and glucocorticoids facilitate and reinstate psychostimulant self-administration in rodents. However, the effects of stress and glucocorticoids on the subjective and behavioral effects of psychostimulants have not been well studied in humans. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of acute hydrocortisone pretreatment on the subjective and behavioral effects of d-amphetamine. METHODS: Hydrocortisone (100 mg) and d-amphetamine (20 mg) were administered orally to 16 healthy male and female volunteers in a four-session, placebo-controlled, within-subject, crossover design. To prevent stomach irritation, subjects received rantidine hydrochloride before each experimental session. Dependent measures included self-reported mood and subjective effects (Addiction Research Center inventory, the profile of mood states, and a series of visual analogue scales), vital signs, salivary cortisol, and psychomotor performance. RESULTS: Hydrocortisone elevated salivary cortisol levels, produced modest dysphoria, and reduced subjects' reports of wanting more drug. However, hydrocortisone pretreatment did not affect any of the physiological, behavioral, or subjective effects of d-amphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the effects of glucocorticoids in rodent studies, these results indicate that an acute increase in cortisol does not enhance the psychostimulant effects of d-amphetamine in humans.
