Interference of biocytin with opioid-evoked hyperpolarization and membrane properties of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons. In our laboratory, preliminary whole-cell, tight seal recordings of rat spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons including biocytin in the patch pipette yielded a significantly smaller proportion of neurons hyperpolarized by selective opioid agonists compared with recordings without biocytin. Therefore, we investigated the effects of biocytin inclusion on opioid responses and other membrane properties during whole-cell, tight seal recordings of these neurons. The percentage of neurons hyperpolarized by mu-, delta(1)-, and kappa-selective opioids was significantly reduced when 1% but not < or =0.2% biocytin was included in the recording pipette, compared with neurons recorded without biocytin. However, a significantly higher proportion of neurons fired spontaneous action potentials with either 0.05-0.2 or 1% biocytin compared to no biocytin. Resting membrane potential, input impedance and the proportion of neurons displaying transient outward rectification were each significantly altered for neurons recorded with 1% but not 0.05-0.2% biocytin. These effects may be due to a relatively specific blockade of diverse potassium channel types. Because efficient labeling can be achieved with 0.1% biocytin with whole-cell recording, higher concentrations are contraindicated.
