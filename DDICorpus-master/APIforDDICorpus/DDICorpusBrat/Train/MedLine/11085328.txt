The effects of DCG-IV and L-CCG-1 upon phencyclidine (PCP)-induced locomotion and behavioral changes in mice. The behavioral changes of mice induced by acute and repeated i.p. injection of phencyclidine (PCP) were observed by measuring locomotor activity and stereotyped behavior. Then, the effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists, DCG-IV and L-CCG-1, on the above behavioral changes induced by PCP were found. The effects of DCG-IV were very strong and completely depressed the PCP-induced hyperlocomotion. The effects of L-CCG-1 were not so strong. Repeated injection of PCP for 20 days into mice induced lower locomotor activity than that in acutely injected mice. These behavioral changes may be related with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In order to examine some molecular mechanisms of PCP-induced behavioral changes, Northern blot analysis of total RNA from prefrontal cortical tissues of mice treated with PCP, DCG-IV, and L-CCG-1 was carried out.
