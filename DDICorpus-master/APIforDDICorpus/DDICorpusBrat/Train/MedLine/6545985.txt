Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between neurotensin and enkephalins or tuftsin. The aim of this paper was to study the interaction between neurotensin and both enkephalins or its synthetic analogue D-Ala2-metenkephalinamide, or tuftsin, on the antinonciceptive effect of these peptides in mice after intracisternal injection. Antinociception was measured by the hot-plate method. It was shown that neurotensin antagonized evidently the antinociceptive effect of enkephalins and their analogue. On the contrary, neurotensin and tuftsin were agonists in induction of analgesia. It is concluded that neurotensin modulates in an opposite way the function of the enkephalinergic neurons and the central action of tuftsin.
