Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of cardiovascular drugs in patients with chronic renal disease. Cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity and a major cause of mortality in patients with chronic renal disease. Drug regimens in patients with cardiovascular disease are frequently complex and can be significantly affected by alterations in renal function. In addition, several cardiovascular drugs directly affect renal function and the management of patients with renal disease. This article reviews the impact of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of cardiovascular drugs and identifies clinically important interactions between these and other drugs commonly used in the management of chronic renal disease. Several classes of cardiovascular drugs are also discussed in relationship to their differential effects on the management and progression of renal disease.
