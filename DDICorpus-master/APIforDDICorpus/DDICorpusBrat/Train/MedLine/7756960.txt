[The effect of sandimmune on the activity of mixed-function mono-oxidases in the liver microsomes] The effects of the immunodepressant--the drug sandimmune--on hepatic microsomal monooxygenase activities were studied. The agent was found to produce some inhibiting activity against hepatic microsomal 7-ethoxycoumarine deethylase in male Wistar rats in vitro and in vivo experiments. When given in a dose of 50 mg/kg, sandimmune produced no statistically significant effect on the duration of hexanal-induced sleep in mice. The findings suggest that the agent has slight effects on the tested activities.
