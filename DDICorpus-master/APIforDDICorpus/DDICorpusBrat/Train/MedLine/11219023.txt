Prescribing. Keys to maximizing benefit while avoiding adverse drug effects. When prescribing for older patients, some physicians are overly cautious, and this strategy can result in a less than optimal treatment outcome. The reluctance to treat aggressively is understandable because the geriatric population is susceptible to adverse drug reactions. The key to maximizing therapy lies in individualizing it as much as possible. There are a number of steps physicians can take to ensure that their patients are not being undertreated. These steps include regular reevaluations of dosages and plasma drug concentrations, recognition and understanding of drug side effects, and avoidance of certain agents. Close monitoring allows physicians to minimize risks, maximize benefits, and get the most out of what modern medications can do to help older patients.
