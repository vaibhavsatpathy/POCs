Phenytoin intoxication induced by fluvoxamine. A patient had phenytoin intoxication after administration of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The serum concentration of phenytoin increased dramatically from 16.6 to 49.1 microg/mL when fluvoxamine was coadministered, although the daily dosage of phenytoin and other drugs had not changed. During phenytoin and fluvoxamine treatment, ataxia, a typical side effect of phenytoin, was observed. The genotypes of CYP2C9 and 2C19, the enzymes responsible for phenytoin metabolism, were homozygous for the wild-type alleles (CYP2C9*1/*1 and 2C19*1/ *1). The interaction may be a result of inhibition of both CYP2C9 and 2C19 by fluvoxamine.
