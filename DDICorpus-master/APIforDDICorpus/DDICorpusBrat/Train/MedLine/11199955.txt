The effects of concomitant phenytoin administration on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Quetiapine fumarate ('Seroquel') is a newly introduced atypical antipsychotic with demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It is extensively metabolized, predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4. Therefore, concurrent administration of drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme may affect quetiapine pharmacokinetics. This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer phenytoin did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of quetiapine, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. These results indicate that dosage adjustment of quetiapine may be necessary when the two drugs are given concurrently and that caution may be required when administering other drugs that inhibit or induce cytochromes, particularly P450 3A4.
